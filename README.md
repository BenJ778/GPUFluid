## About

An experimental implementation of fluid interaction. 

## Features

- Real-time 2D Eulerian fluid simulation based on StableFluids

- Vorticity confinement

- MacCormack advection

## Running application

1. Download prebuilt applitation from [**here**](https://github.com/masatakesato/GPUFluid/releases/download/v0.0.1-alpha/GPUFluid-v.0.0.1-alpha.zip).

2. Extract zip file and execute GPUFluid2D.exe inside bin folder.

## Building application(under construction)

### Prerequisities

Following system configurations are required to build application.

- Windows 10(or later) with Visual Studio Community 2017 installed

- freeglut*

- AntTweakBar* 

- FreeImage* 

*Â Installed under D:\Lib\ in my configuration.

### Setup

1. Clone this repositoty.

2. Create a new folder named "**external**" in the /GPUFluid directory.

3. Download **[OreOreLib](https://github.com/masatakesato/OreOreLib/releases/download/untagged-1ef57314084afa42fb35/oreore.zip)** and put extracted directory into "**external**".

4. Download **[GraphicsLib](https://github.com/masatakesato/GraphicsLib/releases/download/2022q1/graphics.zip)** and put extracted directory into "**external**".

5. Open VisualStudio project "dev\GPUFluid2D\GPUFluid2D\GPUFluid2D.vcxproj".
   Then modify "**Additional Include Directory**" and "**Additional Library Directories**" settings of following libraries
   
   - freeglut
   - AntTweakBar
   - FreeImage

6. Build project.
